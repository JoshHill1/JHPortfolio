        <p>This is my current portfolio; where I display my work and skills as a front-end web developer.</p>
    
        <p>On this page, not only do I display my work; but also describe my thought process And explain how I got to the end result.</p>

        <div class="flexCol">
          <p>This is an image of what I initially sketched out for what to display on my homepage. I figured it would tell the story of how it got me to be where I am today and share some bacground of who I am; but after looking at YouTube videos of people critiquing other portfolios and seeing basic videos of what should (and shouldn't) go on your portfolio, I figured I would be was sharing <i>too much</i> unneccecary info about me. It was still fine to draw out because I then thought that it's something that I could put on my About page instead.</p>
          <p>It does have some things that you do see on the homepage right now; like the nav bar on the top left of the sketch. I dreamed big and wanted it to be animated and something that people can admire for the effort and small detail that was put into this portfolio; just like how I went through making a little background for when you hover over the "J Hill" "logo".</p>
          <p>After Watching videos and thinking about a creative design, I came up with an idea, sketched it out, and asked ChatGPT what else goes in a portfolio.</p>

      <div class="flexSection">
        <img src="./Images/oldIdea.jpg" alt="A sketch displaying an idea of what the homepage could've looked like.">
        <div class="flexCol">
          <p>You can see here how I was trying to go for more of a pixelated look, with a beginning screen of all the links floating around in front of a hero that I would've created. I also showed the first five elements that ChatGPT told me to have for a portfolio.</p>
          <p>After I got the basic layout built in the webpage, I didn't understand what I was thinking for having the nav links not only be shown twice in the same screen, but also the fact that it's the first thing you see and that it takes up the whole screen; so in other words, I thought it was a dumb design flaw that I didn't realize till I actually built it out.</p>

      <div class="flexSection">
        <img src="./Images/GoodOutline.jpg" alt="A final sketch showing a very basic design of what I want the homepage to look like.">
        <div class="flexCol">
          <p>After thinking about another design, it wasn't long for me to go back to the design I was using before but tweak it a little and sort of encorperate both designs together.</p>
          <p>Then, after some time away from working on this and more insight on portfolios and examples of other portfolios that got a job at big companies (using <a href="https://www.cofolios.com/" target="_blank">Cofolios</a>), I saw how little people displayed on their portfolio. So that's what I did; I cut out the about me and skills section and only had my homepage display my welcoming screen and handpicked projects. It was convenient because at the end of the page, I also have a place for the user to navigate to my About or Projects page.</p>
          <p>The footer came naturally; I used <a href="https://haikei.app/">haikei</a> for the complex shape and added all the content I wanted, in the layout that I had in mind :&#41;</p>
          <p></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flexCol">
        <p>From there, I had my layout for the homepage done. I then needed to finish my About, Projects, and Contact page.</p>
        <p>I already had an idea of what I wanted to do for the Projects page and it was already being worked on while finishing the homepage, so that's what I focused on next.</p>
        <p>One thing that I did know while working through this process is that I wanted a plain white background. Although it isn't completely pitch white, it still gives the purpose I had in mind of it looking like a blank sheet of paper with notes on it.</p>

      <p>For this project, our mission was to create a front-end application. We had to use some sort of CSS framework other than Bootstrap (for this project we used <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>), use at least two server-side APIs, make it responsive, have a polished UI, and have a quality README in the GitHub repository.</p>
      <p>I was in a group with three other people and decided my role would be in the front-end side of the website, deciding how the website looks and how people interact with the application.</p>
      <p>Initially, it was challenging to come up with a good idea on what our project should display due to the limited amount of (free) APIs. First we wanted to make something that would make decisions for you, then we thought of a travel app that would give you activities to do in the trip you're planning; it wasn't till the next meeting that we found an API of food recipes and a GIF API to go along with it.</p>
      <p>I had a very basic wireframe that had a huge hero section that would display the random GIF and inside the hero it would display a menu of options to choose from. It had very bland colors at the start of the project but then around the end of it all, I messed with the colors and where the GIF should be displayed, showed it to my group, and gave positive feedback to the new look.</p>
      <p>The room for improvement for this project would be small user experience changes; like for examle, needing to click on the picture of the food item you want to be directed to, in order to see the recipe. Other feedback we got was to not display links in the header like History and Services, if they don't direct you to another page at all.</p>
      <p>Overall, it was a wonderful project to get to work with others and use git and gain experience in merging branches with other partners. It allowed me to learn more CSS skills and get feedback on what to do differently next time.</p>

      <p>Plain And Simple started from a simple post I saw on Instagram made by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cste8SxPY2v/" target="_blank">casketnap</a>. The style he made the text was something I recently got interested in after listening to more heavy metal music and seeing that barely readable, if not, unreadable text in the album covers. I would also get cool fonts people can use or download in certain websites too, but I never really bothered to use any because in the end, if you used the same letter twice, then they would be identical to each other which defeated the purpose of the style in my eyes; so after coming across that post and seeing the process the artis goes through, I wanted to try it myself! I didn't bother to put much effort in coming up with what word I would use. I thought of "PLAIN AND SIMPLE" because of how ironic it was to have such complex and different jagged spikes around the lettering.</p>
